Advent of Code 2022 day 19 Notes
================================

Part 1
------

85 minutes.

Part 2
------

Even after 13 hours and 21 minutes of continuous running, my solution didn't
produce an answer for part 2. I broke down and tried `hyper-neutrino's solution
<https://github.com/hyper-neutrino/advent-of-code>`_.

It produced the correct answer in 17 seconds.

So I'm going to attempt to analyze what is different in my program that makes
it take so much longer.
